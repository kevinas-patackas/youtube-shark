# General info

This is an application that does a few things:

### **Monitors youtube (Yotube Waves)**

Monitors youtube by searching for a specific keyword and outputs it to console and posts message to Slack. Keywords are saved in MongoDb.

- `/api/waves` - serveless function / api end-point that does all the work.
- Vercel cron job triggers it every day at 10AM UTC (only once a day in order to work with free account)

It will only output new videos (sorted by time) since last known published video. If no videos published since last checked - no output.

### **Website to view video comments (Youtube Surfing Shark)**

website where you can provide one or more Youtube video Idâ€™s and fetch the last 20 comments from each of these videos. Fetched information is stored in the MongoDB database, so if a user provides the same video id in a period of 24h _(or whatever time period is provided in env var `MONGODB_COMMENTS_EXPIRATION_MINUTES`)_ then
information is fetched from the database, not from Youtube API.

# !! Known issues / limitations / possible improvements !!

- Test coverage of project is not ideal.
- `/api/waves` endpoint has no restrictions, so anyone can call it and trigger the script. Ideally this should be restricted in some way.
- If free Vercel account is used then monitoring is done only once a day (if you call it "daily digest", then it's kinda okay).
- MongoDb connection is only secured by username/password. All IPs are allowed to access it. Ideally this should be improved.
- Monitoring part will only output up to 100 videos. It's limited to 2 pages of 50 results per request. It is this way to save some youtube API quotas.

# Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

1. mongoDB
2. Youtube Data API V3
3. [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account
4. Slack with webhooks setup (for more info: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)

### **MongoDB Setup**

1. Create database
2. Allow access from any IP (SHOULD BE IMPROVED)
3. create collection for caching comments (`MONGODB_COMMENTS_COLLECTION`)
4. create index for `videoId` field in `MONGODB_COMMENTS_COLLECTION` collection
5. create collection for monitoring youtube search results (`MONGODB_WAVES_COLLECTION`)
6. in `MONGODB_WAVES_COLLECTION` collection create item `{ type: 'keywords', value: 'this will be the search keywords' }`. Field `value` of this object will store keywords that will be searched.

## Local development

### Environment variables

Create `.env.local` file in root directory for local development and populate variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
YOUTUBE_API_KEY="..."
MONGODB_URI="..."
MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME="..."
MONGODB_COMMENTS_COLLECTION="..."
MONGODB_COMMENTS_EXPIRATION_MINUTES="60"
MONGODB_WAVES_COLLECTION="..."
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/....../...../......."
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - base url of the app
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` - Youtube Data API V3 key
- `MONGODB_URI` - connection URI to mongoDB
- `MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME` - Mongo database name where data will be stored
- `MONGODB_COMMENTS_COLLECTION` - Mongo db collection name where cached info about videos/comments will be stored
- `MONGODB_COMMENTS_EXPIRATION_MINUTES` - (optional) time in minutes after which cached data is considered as invalid
- `MONGODB_WAVES_COLLECTION` - Mongo db collection name where info about last monitored search result will be stored and info about search keywords
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - slack webook url to post message

### Running application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Running tests

```bash
npm run test
# for coverage report use
npm run test -- --coverage
```

## Deployment

For deployment please use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Once deployed, make sure to create all enviroment variables found in `Local development` -> `Environment variables`
